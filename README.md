# Backorder-Prediction
Backorder is an order which can’t be fulfilled at the given time due to lack of supply or the product is currently out of stock or not in inventory but can guarantee delivery of the goods or service requested by a certain date in the future because the production of goods or replenishment of inventory is underway. Unlike in the situation of Out-of-stock where the delivery date of the goods can’t be promised, in the Backorder scenario, the customers are allowed to shop for the products and order. Simply put Backorder can be thought of as an order with a delayed delivery date
Machine Learning can identify patterns related to backorders before the customer orders. With this, the production can adjust to minimize delays for customer service and provide accurate dates to keep the customers informed. This predictive analysis approach gives the company ample time to react and enables them to satisfy the demands of customers and smooth the supply chain process. The case study "Backorder Prediction" deals with predicting the backorders of products by applying Machine Learning techniques to overcome or reduce the cost of backorders. We will identify parts with the highest chances of shortage so that we could present a high opportunity to improve the company's overall performance.
